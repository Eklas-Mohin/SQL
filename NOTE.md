# SQL (Structured Query Language)

**SQL**, or **Structured Query Language**, is a programming language designed specifically for managing and interacting with relational databases. It allows users to perform the following essential operations, known as **CRUD**:

1. **Create** – Add new records or data entries into the database.
2. **Read** – Retrieve specific data from the database, often using queries to filter or sort the information.
3. **Update** – Modify existing data entries within the database.
4. **Delete** – Remove data from the database.

Due to its straightforward syntax and powerful querying capabilities, SQL is fundamental in data management, enabling efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and organization in structured databases.

# History of SQL

SQL, or **Structured Query Language**, has an interesting history that traces back to the 1970s.

## Origins of SQL

In the early 1970s, IBM was working on a project to develop a language that could retrieve and manage data stored in relational databases. This led to the creation of **SEQUEL** (Structured English Query Language), which was intended to make data retrieval more intuitive for users.

### SEQUEL and the Relational Model

The development of SEQUEL was based on the relational model of data, which was introduced by **Dr. E. F. Codd** in 1970. Dr. Codd, an IBM researcher, proposed a way of structuring data into tables (or relations), allowing for more flexibility and efficiency in data management. This relational model became the foundation of modern database systems.

## Evolution of SEQUEL to SQL

IBM's **System R** was one of the first implementations of SEQUEL, and it was a prototype relational database system built by IBM in the 1970s. However, due to a trademark dispute, IBM changed the name from SEQUEL to **SQL**.

### Standardization and Adoption

In 1986, **SQL became the standard language for relational databases**, officially standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and later by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Since then, SQL has become the dominant language for database management, adopted by major database systems like **Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL,** and **PostgreSQL**.
